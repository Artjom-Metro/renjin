# GCC Bridge Maven Plugin

The GCC Bridge Maven Plugin is intended to make C, C++ and Fortran sources first class citizens of a 
project targeting the JVM.

See the [gcc-bridge-example](https://github.com/bedatadriven/gcc-bridge-example) project on GitHub for an example
of how to use the plugin to incorporate C sources in a Maven Project.
