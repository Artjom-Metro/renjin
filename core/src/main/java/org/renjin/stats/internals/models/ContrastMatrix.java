/**
 * The contrast matrix specifies how a factor is to be coded into the 
 * model matrix. A single factor with multiple levels will generally 
 * end up coded as several "dummy" variables according to one of several
 * schemes. 
 * 
 * <p>In the simplest example, consider a factor with three levels, "Good", 
 * "Bad", and "Ugly". The simplest contrast matrix will look like:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *       Bad  Ugly
 * Good    0     0  
 * Bad     1     0
 * Ugly    0     1
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>This matrix basically says that the factor should be encoded into two 
 * dummy variables (num columns = 2). Furthermore, if the value of the factor is Bad, 
 * then the value of both dummy variables should be zero, if it's bad, then the first
 * variable is coded as one and the second as zero, etc.</p>
