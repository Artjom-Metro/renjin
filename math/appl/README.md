# Appl

The `appl` library is imported from GNU R and consists of a number of modified `BLAS`, `LAPACK` and `LINKPACK` routines
along side miscellaneous helper functions such as `findInterval` and `R_pretty`.

The C and Fortran sources are compiled to JVM classfiles via [GCC-Bridge](../tools/gcc-bridge)
